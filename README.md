# String-Trouble

Given a string text of length N consisting of the letters 'a', 'b' or 'c'. We can insert any of those letters before or after any letter in the string.

The goal is to insert letters into text so that it will follow the pattern "abcabca..."; i.e. it should start with a letter 'a', letter 'a' should be followed by 'b', letter 'b' should be followed by 'c', and letter 'c' by 'a'. The string may end with any of those three letters.

What is the minimum number of letters we need to insert into text?

Write a function that, given a string text of length N, returns the minimum number of insertions needed to make text follow the described pattern.
